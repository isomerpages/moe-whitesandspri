### **Science**
#### **Objectives**
At White Sands Primary School, we strongly believe that our students are curious inquirers. Leveraging this spirit of curiosity, students are nurtured to be inquisitive thinkers, who not only seek knowledge in Science, but also explore issues and questions that relate to the roles played by Science in daily life, society and the environment. We would like our students to enjoy Science and value Science as an important tool as they explore their natural and physical world to acquire knowledge.

#### **Key Programmes**
##### **Lower Block (P3 and P4)**
The P3 students grow their very own plant. This gives them an opportunity to learn and appreciate the challenges of the planting process and experience the joy of seeing their plants grow. The values of care and responsibility are reinforced. The P4 students learn to take care of their caterpillars, understanding the beautiful and mysterious process involved as they see their caterpillars undergoing different stages to become butterflies. The students also appreciate the great variety, diversity and interactions of the ecosystem as they experience outdoor learning in the garden.

##### **Upper block (P5 and P6)**
The P5 students build their own closed terrariums, a hands-on experience on plant systems and the water cycle which provides students with an understanding of the different processes happening within a self-sustaining ecosystem. Through specially designed Augmented Reality experience garden trail, the P6 students learn how the different factors of an environment affect the survival of living things. The students also get a chance to visit Sungei Buloh to experience flora and fauna in the nature up-close.

##### **Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science Programme**
The school has embarked on the E2K Science Programme Singapore, a Science Enrichment programme, specially developed by the Ministry of Education (Gifted Education Branch) for Primary 4 to Primary 5 students who demonstrate interest and aptitude in Science.

The E2K Programme aims to:
*   Foster independence in scientific inquiry in students
*   Develop Science Process Skills, such as formulating hypothesis, using apparatus and equipment, analysing and evaluating
*   Develop 21stÂ Century Competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills.
