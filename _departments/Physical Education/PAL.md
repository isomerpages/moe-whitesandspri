### **PAL**
#### **Objectives**
Programme for Active Learning (PAL) seeks to provide a greater emphasis on non-academic programmes for all Primary 1 and 2 students. PAL is part of the curriculum and is conducted during the school hours where 4 periods are set aside weekly.

In White Sands Primary School, PAL aims to cater to the holistic development of students in the 5 learning domains (cognitive, moral, social, aesthetics and physical) beyond the learning in the classroom, and to develop their social emotional competencies such as self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship management and responsible decision making.

#### **Key Programmes**
Students are exposed to varied and fun learning experiences through the 4 modules of PAL: **Sports and Games**, **Outdoor Education**, **Performing Arts** and **Visual Arts**. These modules are carried out accordingly to 4 PAL cycles (7 lessons per cycle) yearly for both Primary 1 and Primary 2 students respectively.

Through the 4 modules in PAL, we hope to see students having<br>
\- Experiential learning in nature<br>
\- Encompassed learning in a creative way<br>
\- Opportunities to create<br>
\- Incorporated values and social-emotional learning<br>
\- Fun and enjoyable PAL lessons<br>
\- Confidence, curiosity and cooperation skills

Through all these skills taught through PAL, we hope to prepare them for a more dynamic future.
