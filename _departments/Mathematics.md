### **Mathematics**
#### **Objectives**
At White Sands Primary School, we aspire to enable students to acquire and develop the necessary mathematical concepts, skills and process skills to solve problems and strive for excellence in Mathematics results. In addition, we want to enable them to use connections among mathematical ideas, and between Mathematics and other disciplines to produce imaginative and creative work. Lastly, we also hope to develop positive attitudes in them for continuous learning in Mathematics.

#### **Key Programmes**


#### **Mathematics Enrichment**

**Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme for P4 &amp; P5**

The E2K Mathematics Programme aims to develop students' mathematical reasoning skills and deepens their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach.
Students will have opportunities to work independently or collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through resources such as puzzles, games and mathematical explorations specially designed for this programme. The rich learning experiences offered by the programme serve to help students to:<br>

•	Develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess<br>
•	Gain important 21st century competencies such as critical thinking, invention thinking and effective communication skills<br>
•Teachers who have been trained in the E2K pedagogy run the programme in schools.





##### **Learning Support in Mathematics (LSM)**
Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) is targeted at the lower primary levels. It is an early intervention effort aimed at providing additional support to students who do not have foundational numeracy skills and knowledge to access the primary 1 Maths curriculum. The identified students will be supported by LSM trained teachers during the curriculum. Through the activity-based lessons, the students will be able to achieve small successes to build their confidence and motivation in Mathematics.

##### **Mathematics Recess Play (P1-P6)**

Mathematics Recess Play is a time of joy and learning for students. Students are invited to participate in Mathematics related fun activities like creating symmetrical drawings, answering online Mathematics quizzes and many more.


##### **Creative Maths Programme**
Creative Maths Programme is conducted from P1 to P6. It aims to provide opportunities for students to apply Mathematics concepts through various Mathematics related activities and projects.
