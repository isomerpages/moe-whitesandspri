### **Mathematics**
#### **Objectives**
At White Sands Primary School, we aspire to enable students to acquire and develop the necessary mathematical concepts, skills and process skills to solve problems and strive for excellence in Mathematics results. In addition, we want to enable them to use connections among mathematical ideas, and between Mathematics and other disciplines to produce imaginative and creative work. Lastly, we also hope to develop positive attitudes in them for continuous learning in Mathematics.

#### **Key Programmes**
##### **Learning Support in Mathematics (LSM)**
Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) is targeted at the lower primary levels. It is an early intervention effort aimed at providing additional support to students who do not have foundational numeracy skills and knowledge to access the primary 1 Maths curriculum. The identified students will be supported by LSM trained teachers during the curriculum. Through the activity-based lessons, the students will be able to achieve small successes to build their confidence and motivation in Mathematics.

##### **ICAN Programme**
ICAN (Improvement in Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy) Programme is a learning support programme for the middle primary levels. It is a collaboration between MOE and schools to support low progress learners.

##### **Creative Maths Programme**
Creative Maths Programme is conducted from P1 to P6. It aims to provide opportunities for students to apply Mathematics concepts through various Mathematics related activities and projects.
