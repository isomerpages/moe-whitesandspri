### **Mathematics**
#### **Objectives**
At White Sands Primary School, we aspire to enable students to acquire and develop the necessary mathematical concepts, skills and process skills to solve problems and strive for excellence in Mathematics results. In addition, we want to enable them to use connections among mathematical ideas, and between Mathematics and other disciplines to produce imaginative and creative work. Lastly, we also hope to develop positive attitudes in them for continuous learning in Mathematics.
