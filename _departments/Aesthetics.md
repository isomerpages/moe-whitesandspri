### **Aesthetics**
#### **Objectives**
The Art & Music Instructional Programme seeks to foster inventive thinking, communication skills, as well as global and cross-cultural literacy. 

#### **Key Programmes**

 A key focus of our Visual Art education is to instill in students the artistic dispositions for the holistic development of the whole child. In WSPS, our students learn through PLAY, Differentiated Instruction, Inquiry-Based Learning to explore the art curriculum. They also have the opportunity to choose their own medium and art form (Choice-Based Curriculum) to showcase their learning of a topic. 
 
Throughout their 6 years, students will be exposed to fundamental skills in handling 2 and 3-dimensional media, where they are encouraged to experiment with various art materials and techniques, explore and describe visual and tactile qualities; thereby developing their ability to articulate thoughts and feelings about art and be exposed to the richness of Culture and Heritage during the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - one of WSPS’ distinctive programmes. 

To cultivate a sense of pride in their artistic accomplishments, students participate in activities such as Gallery Walks within their own classes, where they can give feedback to their peers. Their artworks are also displayed school-wide and online, via platforms like Padlet, and showcased at the year-end art exhibition on Prize-Giving Day.

In Music lessons, students are exposed to a broad range of music and activities to develop their listening, music making as well as musical understanding. At the Lower Primary, students learn to express themselves through the fundamentals of music making activities like singing, performing and creating music on classroom-percussion instruments. At the Middle Primary, they deepen their fundamentals by moving on to play and create music on music keyboards and Garage Band. Students also develop cross-cultural literacy as they immerse in the vibrant sounds of the diverse cultures through the Ethnic Drumming module and World Music module. At the Upper Primary, as students continue to broaden their music-making skills through playing ukulele, there is also more focus on the creative and compositional aspects of music where students learn basic sequencing skills to create their own song as well as record sounds digitally through the use of GarageBand.

To nurture students’ musical talents and confidence, opportunities such as My Stage, SYF Youth Station Project and other school events are provided to showcase their musical abilities and gain performance experiences.
