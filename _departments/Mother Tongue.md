Lensa Si Cilik Competition, generously supported and funded by MLLPC, is an annual national event hosted at White Sands Primary School. Geared towards nurturing a passion for the Malay Language in our digital native students, the competition focuses on crafting comic scripts incorporating proverbs. While the 2018-2019 competitions took place both online and on-site, the subsequent years, 2020-2022, transitioned to an online format due to Covid constraints. The culmination of students' efforts resulted in the creation of three published comic booklets, distributed to primary schools across Singapore. Inaugurated in 2023, this competition seeks to further enrich the appreciation for Malay Language by encouraging creative expression through the exploration of proverbs. Participants are tasked with producing a 1-minute short story video that creatively integrates proverbs through a short role-play.
