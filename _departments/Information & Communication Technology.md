### **Information & Communication Technology**
#### **Objectives**
At White Sands Primary School, we endeavour to create a digital environment ready for the next century, to enhance students’ learning experiences, preparing them as future-ready and responsible digital learners, and to empower teachers as designers of learning experiences and environment.

#### **Key Programmes**
##### **ICT in Teaching and Learning**
ICT is integrated into the curriculum to allow our pupils to experience quality learning empowered with technology. Teachers make use of a variety of pedagogical practices such as e-pedagogy and active learning to leverage on digital technologies to deepen students’ understanding and learning. Teachers also design quality online resources to provide students opportunities to take ownership of their learning and explore their interests.

##### **Cyber Wellness**
Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace.

The focus of CW is about helping students to become responsible digital learners. When navigating cyberspace, students should demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe and responsible use.

Students should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive use of technology for the good of the community.
