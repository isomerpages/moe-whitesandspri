### **Our History**
White Sands Primary School started in January 1998 with 222 pupils in the premises of Park View Primary School. By the end of 1998, the new school building at 2 Pasir Ris Street 11 was completed.

The school moved to its present site in January 1999 and held its official opening in July 2000. Prior to 2001, the school had functioned as a single-session school. With the increased enrolment, double session was introduced in 2001. In 2008, the school adopted the 4-2 approach. Four levels (P3 - P6) were in the morning session while 2 levels (P1 & P2) were in the afternoon session. The school started operating as single session since 2015.

White Sands Primary School is a new merger between Coral Primary School and White Sands Primary School in January 2019. The new merged school, which is led by Ms Audrey Wong, continues to operate at 2, Pasir Ris Street 11. A new school crest embodies a new beginning while the retention of key colours from the crests of both Coral Primary School and White Sands Primary School links the new school to a common heritage. The design of the school uniform, PE attire and shoes are adopted from the former White Sands Primary School.

While both Coral Primary School and White Sands Primary have served the community for more than 20 years, the merger presents an exciting future for students and staff in both schools. As our new school motto urges, we will “Learn, Grow and Excel Together”.

With the merger, elements from both schools are integrated to strengthen the holistic experience for the students. For example, the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Coding and Computational Thinking and the Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) in Visual Arts are key programmes in the merged White Sands Primary School that each belonged to both former schools. Hence, the students in the merged school will now enjoy an enhanced learning experience from these two unique programmes.

Finally, as we move forward together as one new entity, the key milestones of both Coral Primary School and White Sands Primary School will be encapsulated in the Heritage Gallery to share with students, staff and visitors the history of both schools prior to the merger.
