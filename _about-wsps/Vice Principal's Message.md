### **Vice-Principals' Message**

Aristotle once said, “Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.” As we continued to live with Covid-19 since last year, it is indeed heartening to observe how our students and staff have continued to embrace these challenges with confidence, steadfastness and fortitude. As we eased Safe Management Measures in the later part of last year, it was heartwarming to know how engaged and exhilarated the students were as they embarked on Learning Journeys and face to face interactions during key school events such as Heartshine, Teachers’ Day and the year-end ‘Celebration of Excellence’ during both Little Achievers Day and Big Champs Day for the annual prize-giving. I am proud that our staff and students had adapted well and seized these opportunities to the best of their ability.

  

White Sandians continued to be enthused in diverse school programmes and activities including our distinctive programmes for ALP in the area of Coding and Computational Thinking as well as HeARTs (Heritage Arts) Showcase for LLP across the various levels. For ALP, the P2s learnt to be creative problem solvers with computational thinking skills as they created digital animations while the P4s created prototypes for smart home living using applications such as Micro:bit and Makecode. For LLP at P3, the students underwent Chinese Hand Brush Painting as we exposed them to Chinese Heritage Art form. As they indulged in painting bamboos and pandas using Chinese brush painting strokes on rice paper, they learnt about the history and culture as well as the discipline and values that come along with it.

  

With the resumption of National School Games, many of our student athletes from CCAs such as Football (Boys and Girls), Netball, Table tennis, Wushu and Swimming teams represented the school in various games and competitions. The performing arts CCAs namely Choir, Guzheng, Chinese Dance, Malay Dance and Modern Dance were also represented in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) in 2022. They all did the school proud with their various success stories as they competed and participated actively. Both the Environmental Science Club members and Cyberwellness Ambassadors had several outreach opportunities last year as well. In line with the SG Green Plan, members of the Environmental Science Club spread awareness about food wastage and its impact on the environment via posters displayed at Pasir Ris Central Hawker Centre to serve as a reminder to the public to play their part. The Cyberwellness Ambassadors encouraged members of the public to be more cyber savvy via a display at the entrance of Pasir Ris Public Library. They promoted themes on Cyber Safety to encourage the community to be safe and responsible users online.

  

Our teachers strived to continue to provide a holistic education to all students through innovative ways of organizing school experiences. Based on the theme of ‘Exploring the Outdoors’, the P4 students explored outdoor cooking, learnt basic navigation skills and designed mini rafts. The campers acquired decision making and collaborative skills during the camp. The P5 camp, which was centred on the theme of ‘I am a Resilient Camper’, provided opportunities for our P5 students to rally together by forging friendships and demonstrating resilience during coastal exploration and place-based activities. Apart from cohort camps, an X-Factor Leadership Camp was also organized specially for the P3 to P5 Students Leaders to sharpen their leadership potential and skills through several team building activities.

  

In White Sands, we will continue to promote Positive Education via the ‘GROW With Me’ journey as we cultivate a growth mindset in every student. In order to develop the knowledge, skills and values of consistently putting in their best, the Resilient Achievers Programme (RAP) and Responsible Achievers Programme (ReAP) for the Upper and Middle Primary will be strengthened. We will also be embarking on the Caring Achievers Programme (CAP) for the Lower Primary this year via a myriad of skills to be acquired.

Moving forward in 2023, we will forge together to realise our school vision of Every White Sandian, A Success Story through a forward-looking balanced and holistic education, a vibrant learning community with a caring culture, continuous staff professional development and close collaboration with our parents, stakeholders and partners.

We will learn, grow and excel together.

It is with great enthusiasm that I extend a warm welcome to each and every one of you as we embark on a promising new academic year at White Sands Primary School.&nbsp; Serving as a Vice-Principal (Administration), I take pride in being part of a community that is committed to nurturing success stories and upholding our school’s vision of “Every White Sandian, a success story.” &nbsp;

In White Sands, we value all White Sandians and aim to nurture them to passionate learners with exemplary character who lead with a heart and contribute to the society.&nbsp; The close collaboration between our teachers and the school administration and operations team creates an environment that fosters enriching experiences for our White Sandians to learn, grow and excel.

Reflecting on the past, our White Sandians have demonstrated resilience and commitment. Guided by our school values and the unwavering support of their families, they have not only faced challenges but emerged triumphant. Their caring spirit, sense of responsibility and resilience are testaments to their growth and success stories.

As we step into the new year, let the year be a canvas of opportunities, a landscape of shared achievements and a chapter of personal growth. Our commitment remains strong to enhance the overall White Sands experience through our positive school-home-community partnership.
