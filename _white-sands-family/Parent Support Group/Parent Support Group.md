#### **Key Involvement:**
The PSG supports school programmes and events such as HeARTshine, Teachers’ Day and Children’s Day. With the knowledge, support, and expertise rendered by the PSG, their hope is to encourage all White Sandians to develop greater motivation to manage their own personal growth, be more engaged in learning while experiencing the joy of learning.

#### **Highlights of past activities:**
**1) Annual Partners’ Appreciation Lunch**<br>
The Partners’ Appreciation Lunch is an annual event where the school expresses its gratitude for the hard work and support provided by members of the Parent Support Group. During the event, the school was also able to recognise and acknowledge the contributions by the PSG Exco members and long-serving members of PSG.

**2) Mother's Day Sale 2022**<br>
Annually, WSPS Parent Support Group (PSG) organises Mother’s Day Sale for White Sandians. The sale features hand-made gifts and cards which pupils can purchase at affordable prices to show appreciation for their beloved mothers on this special occasion. The sale is organised for a meaningful cause as all proceeds are channeled to funding the studying expenses of less fortunate pupils.

**5)** **Teacher's Day Celebrations**<br>
Teachers’ Day celebration is also an annual event where PSG joins the children in showing appreciation for the teachers at WSPS. When Safety Management Measures eased in 2022, PSG members put up a spectacular dance during the Teachers’ Day concert to express their gratitude to all WSPS teachers while in 2021, PSG members surprised the teachers with a holiday-themed photo booth, decked with handmade props including crafted passports for the enthusiastic ‘travelers’. 

These props required time and effort, especially during this period where strict social distancing measures had to be adhered to but members rallied together and were able to complete them in a short period of time. In addition, the PSG members produced a video featuring current and former White Sandians sending well-wishes to their beloved teachers on this special day of the year.
