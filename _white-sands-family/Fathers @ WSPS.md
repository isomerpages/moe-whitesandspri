#### **Objectives:**
Fathers@School is a key initiative and part of a larger vision for the Dads for Life movement which provides opportunities to engage fathers to be involved in their children’s lives.

White Sands Primary School launched its first Fathers@School activity in September 2010 with a group of 8 dedicated fathers. Today, this number has multiplied to more than 30 enthusiastic and committed fathers who work together to heighten the spirit of learning and camaraderie amongst the team members and engage all fathers in WSPS in planned activities.

Programmes planned for FamilyMatters@School are conducted with the following objectives:<br>
\- Promote father-child bonding<br>
\- Equip fathers with parenting and marriage skills<br>
\- Enable fathers to help other fathers become active contributors to the school.

#### **Key Involvement:**
The group of fathers organises events that are exciting, engaging, and effective to bring out the best father-child moments and everlasting memories. They also actively engage and participate in all school activities and celebrations like HeARTshine, Teacher’s Day, Children’s Day, and other key school events. 

The WSPS community of fathers also provide support for each other through Fathers@WSPS closed Facebook page and WhatsApp chat group. They organise regular get-together sessions such as ‘makan’ sessions, coffee get-together & family gatherings which help to forge brotherhood amongst members of the group. Fathers@WSPS is an active group of fathers who continuously seek to partner the school for the benefit of White Sandians and nurture them to become active contributors of the society with exemplary character.

#### **Highlights of past activities:**
**1) Annual Partners' Appreciation Lunch**<Br>
The Partners’ Appreciation Lunch is an annual event where the school expresses its gratitude for the hard work and support provided by members of Fathers@WSPS. During the event, the school was also able to recognise and acknowledge the contributions by Exco members of Fathers@WSPS and long-serving members of the group.

**2)** **2022 Toy-Making Competition**<br>
Fathers and their children collaborated to come up with innovative ways to create toys out of recycled materials! Participants had fun stretching their creativity and coming up with ingenious and fun mechanisms as toys! The top 3 creations were also able to win prizes while all participants received a certificate of participation.

**3) 2022 March Holiday Program**<br>
Fathers and their children had a go at learning the basics of Aikido! Participants learned the basics of how to fall, how to evade attacks and to counter the assailant’s movements while having a good time throwing each other on padded mats (some of the kids were able to throw their dads down too).

**4)** **2022 Intertidal Walk**<br>
Fathers and children were provided with the opportunity to walk along the banks of Pasir Ris Park Beach and receive a first-hand experience with areas on the beach which are usually covered by water! This was a wonderful father-child bonding activity of which a guided tour was included to obtain a better understanding of the flora and fauna, as well as the different types of wildlife in the environment.
