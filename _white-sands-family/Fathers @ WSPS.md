#### **Objectives:**
Fathers@School is a key initiative and part of a larger vision for the Dads for Life movement which provides opportunities to engage fathers to be involved in their children’s lives.

White Sands Primary School launched its first Fathers@School activity in September 2010 with a group of 8 dedicated fathers. Today, this number has multiplied to more than 30 enthusiastic and committed fathers who work together to heighten the spirit of learning and camaraderie amongst the team members and engage all fathers in WSPS in planned activities.

Programmes planned for FamilyMatters@School are conducted with the following objectives:<br>
\- Promote father-child bonding<br>
\- Equip fathers with parenting and marriage skills<br>
\- Enable fathers to help other fathers become active contributors to the school.

#### **Key Involvement:**
The group of fathers organises events that are exciting, engaging, and effective to bring out the best father-child moments and everlasting memories. They also actively engage and participate in all school activities and celebrations like HeARTshine, Teacher’s Day, Children’s Day, and other key school events. 

The WSPS community of fathers also provide support for each other through Fathers@WSPS closed Facebook page and WhatsApp chat group. They organise regular get together sessions such as ‘makan’ sessions, coffee get together & family gatherings which help to forge brotherhood amongst members of the group. Fathers@WSPS is an active group of fathers who continuously seek to partner the school for the benefit of our pupils and nurture them to grow to be happy students with exemplary character.

#### **Highlights of past activities:**

Fathers and their children collaborated to come up with innovative ways to create toys out of recycled materials!

**4)** **2021 T-Shirt Competition**<br>
Father and child collaborated to create the next generation of T-Shirt designs for Fathers@WSPS!
