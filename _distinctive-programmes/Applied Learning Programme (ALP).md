### **Applied Learning Programme ( ALP )**
#### **Objective:**
Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in White Sands focuses on the domain of Coding. With ALP, we aim to nurture White Sandians to be creative problem solvers with computational thinking skills.

#### **Key Programmes:**
ALP in White Sands takes on the 2-tiered approach: Acquirers and Achievers Tiers.
At the Acquirers Tier, the school provides broad-based programmes that are meaningful and purposeful for students of each level. Students will have the opportunities to appreciate how digital technologies work and apply their learning in authentic settings. As students acquire new skills through the use of various digital tools, they learn to curate, create, communicate and collaborate with others responsibly. 

At the Achievers Tier, students in the CCA Computing Club are actively engaged to expand their knowledge of digital making and to hone their coding and programming skills. While deepening their knowledge and skills, they work on group projects and have the opportunities to take part in external nation-wide competitions. These allow the students to showcase their talent, gain experiences and develop their interests.

These experiential learning through ALP develops 21st Century Competencies (21CC) in White Sandians, and provides opportunities for experimentation, self-discovery, and joy of learning. As we continue our ALP endeavour in this increasingly digitalised world, White Sandians will be nurtured to become creative, self-directed, engaged and passionate learners.
