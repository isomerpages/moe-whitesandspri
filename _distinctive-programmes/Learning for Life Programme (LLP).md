### **Learning for Life Programme ( LLP )**
#### **Objective:**
At White Sands, the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) celebrates the Visual Arts (VA) through a focus on heritage art forms. Branded as HeARTs (Heritage Art Showcase), this programme offers every White Sandian immersive, real-world experiences designed to nurture character and values, foster positive attitudes and self-expression, and strengthen interpersonal skills. The LLP aims to cultivate a deep appreciation for aesthetics and the visual arts while inspiring students to connect with their cultural roots.

#### **Key Programmes:**
#### Tier 1: A Schoolwide Journey into Heritage Art

Tier 1 programmes engage the entire school community in hands-on explorations of heritage art. Students embark on a creative journey to express their cultural pride through:

* Crafting self-portraits that reflect personal and cultural identity.

* Exploring neighbourhood playgrounds, including celebrating the nostalgic "Dragon Playground" of yesteryears.

* Discovering the vibrant art of Cantonese Opera Masks.

* Creating abstract representations of their family dynamics.

* Mastering the intricate techniques of Batik Painting.

* Immersing themselves in the rich tapestry of Peranakan Culture.


These activities not only enhance studentsâ€™ artistic skills but also deepen their understanding of heritage, fostering a sense of cultural awareness and respect.

#### Tier 2: Nurturing Talents and Inclusion

Tier 2 offers a more specialised approach, tailored for Art Club CCA students and those demonstrating exceptional potential in visual arts. The Art Talent Development (ATD) programme provides opportunities for skill refinement and deeper artistic exploration, ensuring students can excel in their creative pursuits. Key components of Tier 2 include:

* A specialised ATD track for refining artistic skills.

* Early talent identification for P2 students, paving the way for Art Club recruitment.

* A dedicated ATD programme for SEN (Special Educational Needs) students, promoting inclusivity and ensuring all children have the chance to thrive artistically.

This tier underscores personalised pathways, empowering students to craft their unique artistic journeys within a supportive and inclusive school environment.

### **Our Vision:**

Through this holistic and tiered approach, the LLP at White Sands not only nurtures artistic excellence but also fosters a lifelong passion for the arts. By connecting students with their cultural heritage, we aim to develop well-rounded, engaged individuals who appreciate the beauty of art and its role in shaping identity and community.
