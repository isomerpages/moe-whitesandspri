### **Learning for Life Programme ( LLP )**
#### **Objective:**
Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in White Sands focusses on the Visual Arts (VA) of Heritage Art forms. HeARTs (Heritage Art Showcase) provides every White Sandian with real-life experiential learning to develop their character and values, cultivate positive attitudes and self-expression; and strengthen their people skills. It aims to nurture students with a keen sense of Aesthetics and an appreciation for the VA.

#### **Key Programmes:**
In Tier 1, spanning specific levels or the entire school community, students engage in hands-on exploration of our Heritage Art. They learn to master Clay building techniques, study the Vanda Miss Joaquim and the intricate strokes of the Chinese Brush and Batik Painting; and immerse themselves in the Peranakan Art. This enriching environment promotes cultural awareness and respect.

Transitioning to Tier 2, the LLP tailors an approach for Art Club CCA students and those excelling in visual arts. The Art Talent Development (ATD) program offers a specialised track for skill refinement, providing a platform for deeper exploration. A second ATD program identifies P2 students with potential for Art Club recruitment, ensuring early talent development.

Tier 2 underscores individualised pathways, allowing students to shape their unique artistic journey within our supportive school community.

This holistic approach not only cultivates academic excellence but also fosters a lifelong passion for the arts, setting the stage for well-rounded and engaged individuals.
