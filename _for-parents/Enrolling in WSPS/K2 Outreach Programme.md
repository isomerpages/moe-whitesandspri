### **K2 Outreach Programme**

White Sands Primary School (WSPS) annually partners Kindergartens in the Pasir Ris precinct to provide K2 schoolers with the opportunity to experience the school life of a Primary School student as part of the school’s Outreach Programme. 

After a warm welcome from WSPS Principal – Ms Audrey Wong, the K2 schoolers would get to learn about the interesting learning experiences of a White Sandian through the WSPS Outreach Publication – a unique White Sands publication which infuses engagement activities along with interesting facts about White Sands Primary School. During this time, the K2 students would interact with WSPS Student Leaders and get to understand what it entailed to be a Primary School student. 

Thereafter, the Student Leaders led the K2 students on a school tour to visit the interesting learning venues on campus, with the final stop being at the school canteen which would be the highlight of the day’s programme – canteen experience. Amidst a light-hearted and jovial atmosphere, the K2 schoolers concluded their visit to White Sands Primary School and we would look forward to them joining us as formal students of the school in time to come!
