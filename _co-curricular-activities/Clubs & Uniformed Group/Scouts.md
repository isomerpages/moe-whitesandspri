### **Scouts**
The objective of our Cub Scouts program is to provide an environment, which is intellectually stimulating, physically vital and directed towards getting the Scouts members to learn how to face and overcome challenges. Self-developmental activities that inculcate values are conducted through games and interaction with others, with “Fun and Discovery” being an integral part of the activities. Cub Scouts will recite the Scout Promise and Scout Law during every CCA session, and the values are also practiced during the activities and internalized by our Scouts.

Under the guidance of our Scouts teachers, our cubs earn proficiency badges when they become proficient in something they love, or when they try out something new. From cooking and astronomy to photography and navigation, there is always something for everyone! Through engagement in these fun activities, our cubs also gain new knowledge and skills. During the CCA sessions, our cubs acquire survival skills such as first aid, and campcraft skills such as tent-pitching and outdoor cooking. 

Our CCA works closely with external partners to develop quality learning experiences for our cubs. For instance, we collaborate with schools to organize camps and activities for our cubs. In addition to that, our scouts also participate actively in events and competitions organized by the Singapore Scout Association. These platforms provide opportunities for our scouts to make new friends. To instill the values of care and responsibility, our scouts are involved in community service with our partnering homes. We hope that with such engagements, our scouts will be responsible and caring individuals who contribute to the betterment of the society and the world.
