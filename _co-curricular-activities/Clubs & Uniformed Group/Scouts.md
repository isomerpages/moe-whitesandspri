### **Scouts**
The objective of our Cub Scouts program is to provide an environment, which is intellectually stimulating, physically vital and directed towards getting the Scouts members to learn how to face and overcome challenges. Self-developmental activities that inculcate values are conducted through games and interaction with others, with “Fun and Discovery” being an integral part of the activities. Cub Scouts will recite the Scout Promise and Scout Law during every CCA session, and the values are also practiced during the activities and internalized by the Scout members at all times.

Under the guidance of Scouts teachers, Scout Cubs also earn proficiency badges to become an expert in something they love, or to try out something new to them. From cooking and astronomy to photography and navigation, there is something for everyone, carrying out fun activities and gaining new knowledge at the same time. 

The club carries out in-school activities such as the Annual 2 days 1 night Scout camp in school with campfire experience and Community Services. In order to allow Cub Scouts to make friends and establish harmonious relationships with others, we also take part in activities organised by Singapore Scout Association.
