### **Infocomm Technology (Computing)**
The Infocomm Club CCA aims to excite students about Information Communication and Technology (ICT) in a fun and meaningful way by helping them to learn various multimedia skills such as use of digital media, coding, animations and games development. The club also aims to cultivate leadership and entrepreneurship capabilities at an early age.

During CCA sessions, club members will learn to program their own interactive stories, games, animations and codes. They can also share their creations with others in the online community. Infocomm Club members learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. These are essential skills for life in the 21st century.

The Infocomm studentsâ€™ ICT curiosity are nurtured through various activities and participation in national-wide competition which incorporates social, family and school values. Students take part in a variety of Infocomm related competitions such as National Coding Competition (NCC) and National Primary Games Creation Competition (NPGCC).
