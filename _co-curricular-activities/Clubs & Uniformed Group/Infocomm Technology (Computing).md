### **Infocomm Technology (Computing)**
Our school's ICT Computing Club is a dynamic platform where students dive into the realms of technology, innovation, and creativity. It strives to ignite students' interest in Information Communication and Technology (ICT) through engaging and purposeful activities, guiding them in acquiring diverse multimedia skills including digital media utilization, coding, animation, and game development. The club also aims to cultivate leadership at an early age and empower students with the skills, knowledge, and confidence to thrive in an increasingly digital world.

During CCA sessions, club members will learn to program their own interactive stories, games, animations and codes. They can also learn to think creatively, reason systematically and work collaboratively which are the essential skills for life in the 21st century.

The studentsâ€™ ICT curiosity is nurtured through various activities and participation in national-wide competition which incorporates social, family and school values. Students take part in a variety of Infocomm related competitions such as National Thinkers Challenge (NTC), Pei Hwa Hackathon, National Primary Games Creation and Coding Competition (NPGC3), National Design Project (NDP) and others.
