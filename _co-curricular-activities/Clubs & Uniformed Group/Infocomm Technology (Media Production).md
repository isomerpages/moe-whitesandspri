### **Infocomm Technology (Media Production)**
At Infocomm Technology (Media Production) Club, we aim to nurture our students to become well-informed and concerned citizens, who are critical thinkers and able to communicate effectively through  e-Journalism.

Over a period of 4 years, our members will acquire knowledge and skills of both photojournalism and video-journalism. They take part in hands-on activities and participate in individual/ group projects to create digital products. By teaching students practical techniques of photography and videography, learning is purposeful and our members truly experience the joy of learning.

In addition, members will have the opportunities to hone their photography and videography talent through inter-department collaborations, coverage of school events and happenings, and taking part in nationwide competitions for instance “Our School, Our Stories” and “Schools Digital Media Awards (SDMA)”.  

Through our meaningful activities and experiences, we hope to instill the school’s core values of C4RE in our students and nurture them to become confident and independent individuals.
