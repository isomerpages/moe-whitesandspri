### **Art Club**
The White Sands Primary School Art Club is made up of students who have a passion and inclination towards the area of Visual Arts along with the correct aptitude towards hard work, risk taking and the tenacity to face adversity with the intent of overcoming it. Art Club members learn to develop the confidence they need to stand by their creations and its message.  

The objectives of Art Club include: 
<br>
•	Fostering Creative Expression<br>
•	Enhancing Critical Thinking &amp; Cultivating Confidence<br>
•	Encouraging Teamwork and Collaboration<br>
•	Promoting Resilience and Emotional Intelligence


In 2023, our dedicated Art Club students excelled in Category C at the Singapore Youth Festival! Their artwork received "Special Mention" and was selected for on-site exhibition at the Stamford Arts Centre. 


The club has always aimed to encourage students to think creatively, critically and independently. Our members are encouraged to always display the school values above all else. Through experienced teacher facilitators, our members discover and learn skills and techniques that extend their learning from their Art Curriculum while at the same time have the opportunity to counter obstacles with problem solving skills.
