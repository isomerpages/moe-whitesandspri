### **Angklung**
Angklung was one of the first CCAs established. The CCA has had its share of glory with Gold and Distinction Awards at the SYF Central Judging over the years. The Angklung ensemble also had public performances at zonal Arts Festivals, the Esplanade, at National Day commemorations and an invitation to perform ‘live’ on OKTO Channel.

Angklung is offered as a CCA to instil in our students a love for music and rhythm and to allow for students to experience artistic expression. The Angklung CCA also brings across the message of our school’s Core Values – the C4RE, as students learn to work together harmoniously and respectfully, be responsible and produce their mark of excellence through their performance of their musical pieces.
