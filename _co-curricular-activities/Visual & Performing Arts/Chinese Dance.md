### **Chinese Dance**
White Sands Primary School Chinese Dance CCA has developed numerous generations of students with an appreciation for the arts. In celebration of its rich traditional culture, our students work collaboratively to produce a piece of dance each time. In this vibrant environment, students will be given opportunities to learn the basics of Chinese dance, the history behind the dances before advancing to the more technical aspect of it.

In Chinese Dance CCA, students will also be able to improve on their relationship management while learning to work together with others during the learning and practising of the dance. Students will learn how to self-manage their own emotions and work on their own individual capabilities, as well as group coordination, to come together to perform for all.

Senior students get to mentor the younger ones over the years and in time build a virtuous and healthy cycle of welcoming and encouraging new students. The CCA aims to raise the dancers’ self-esteem and recognise their own capabilities. Not leaving anyone behind, every student will be given an opportunity to showcase her ability during school events (e.g. Teacher’s day, Prize Giving Day, Heartshine) and public events.
