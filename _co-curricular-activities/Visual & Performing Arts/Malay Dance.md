### **Malay Dance**
Malay Dance CCA endeavours to provide our Malay dancers with the opportunity to learn the five different genres of Malay traditional dance; Asli, Inang, Masri, Zapin and Joget. They are given various platforms via school events, external performances, and competitions for the pupils to showcase their talents. They had the opportunity to perform at Fiesta Bahasa, organize by MOE CPDD (Malay Language Branch). We also seek to elevate their self-esteem, confidence and ignite their passion in Malay Dance continuously.

The various public performances create opportunities for the students to appreciate a variety of Malay Dance genres, develop positive social and leadership skills and acquire values like resilience, responsibility, self-discipline and commitment. Through the CCA sessions, our dancers learn to work collaboratively as a team to ensure the success of each and every dance performance.
