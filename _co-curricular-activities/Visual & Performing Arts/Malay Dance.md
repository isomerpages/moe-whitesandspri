### **Malay Dance**
Malay Dance CCA endeavours to provide our Malay dancers with the opportunity to learn the 5 different genres of Malay traditional dance; Asli, Inang, Masri, Zapin and Joget. They are given various platforms via school events, external performances and competitions for the pupils to showcase their talents. We also seek to elevate their self-esteem, confidence and ignite their passion in Malay Dance continuously.

The various public performances create opportunities for the students to appreciate a variety of Malay Dance genres, develop positive social and leadership skills and acquire values like resilience, responsibility, self-discipline and commitment. Through the CCA sessions, our dancers learn to work collaboratively as a team to ensure the success of each and every dance performance.
