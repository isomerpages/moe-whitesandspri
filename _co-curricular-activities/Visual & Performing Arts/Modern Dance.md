### **Modern Dance**
The Modern Dance CCA is offered to Primary 3 to Primary 6 students who have a passion for dance.

Dance teaches resilience and discipline alongside other school values which are regularly reinforced by our team of dedicated teachers. The Modern Dance CCA prides itself on the strong friendships forged and rapport between the dancers and teachers.

With the exposure to various activities and performances, we hope to enrich each of our dancers with the qualities that would carry them through their academic and non-academic pursuits. The extraordinary journey that each dancer experiences is only made possible because we believe in caring for one another and soaring to greater heights as one.

Our White Sandian dancers are given the opportunity to discover and explore the dance techniques and choreography in various genres including Hip Hop, K-Pop, Modern and Contemporary Dance, developing them to be versatile dancers.

Students are presented with opportunities to perform at both internal and external events, such as the school’s Chinese New Year Celebrations, Prize Giving Day and also at community events such as Racial Harmony Day or Mid-Autumn Festival. Selected students also get to participate in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival Competitions. Through these exposures, our dancers develop leadership and the school’s C4RE values.
