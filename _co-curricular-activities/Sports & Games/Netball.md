### **Netball**
The Netball CCA programme in White Sands Primary School is designed to introduce and cultivate a love for the sport among our pupils. With a focus on skill development, teamwork, and sportsmanship, the netball programme provides a platform for our young athletes to enhance their physical abilities and to foster a competitive spirit. 

Through regular training sessions, the annual National School Games (NSG), friendly matches and annual Netball carnivals, our pupils learn the fundamentals of netball, including passing, shooting, and defending strategies. The programme also aims to instill our school core values of care, respect, responsibility, resilience, rallying together and excellence through our weekly trainings, activities and competitions. 

Coached by experienced netball trainers, our pupils are guided and encouraged to reach their full potential while enjoying the camaraderie of being part of a team. The programme not only promotes physical fitness, it also helps our pupils develop essential life skills that can be carried forward into their secondary education and beyond.
