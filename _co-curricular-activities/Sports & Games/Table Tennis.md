### **Table Tennis**
The objective of our Table Tennis CCA is to integrate holistic education through sports. We place emphasis on the development of skills, character building and nurturing of qualities that will better prepare students to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing world. Pupils are provided with a supportive learning environment so that they develop to become confident and active contributors.

Besides equipping our players with table tennis techniques and skills, we develop leadership by selecting team leaders to facilitate CCA activities in table tennis, for example organising mini matches among the players themselves.
Our players also develop their Social and Emotional Competencies as they learn to recognise and manage their emotions, develop care and concern for others, make responsible decisions, establish positive relationships, as well as overcome challenges.

Our Table Tennis CCA programme provides a breadth of experience through practising skills with different schoolmates and depth in the development of skills through effective coaching. Outstanding players are selected to participate in the annual National School Games (NSG).
