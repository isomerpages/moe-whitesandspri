### **Football Boys**
Football is offered to boys who want to experience the team sport at a young age. The young talents are taught basic skills, including the body and mental strength, agility and coordination according to their readiness levels.

Our aim is to provide the boys with an experience to develop their talent, learn new techniques and life skills as well as gain experiences that develop their character. They undergo training under the guidance of our dedicated coaches. They are also supported by the teachers and parents for training sessions and competitions.

Sportsmanship and character building are the key focus of the Football Programme. Through the various activities and exposure, we hope to instil our schoolâ€™s core values of C4RE, and develop the 21st CC skills in the players.

On top of emerging East Zone Champions in 2012, 2017 and 2018, the Football Team has appeared in 12 podiums and 8 Finals in the last 5 years. We take great pride in preparing our boys beyond their time in primary school and we have the honour of being a prominent contributor of talent towards the National age group teams.
