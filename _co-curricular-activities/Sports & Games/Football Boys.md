### **Football Boys**
Football is offered to boys who want to experience the team sport at a young age. The young talents are taught basic skills, including the body and mental strength, agility and coordination according to their readiness levels.

Our aim is to provide the boys with an experience to develop their talent, learn new techniques and life skills as well as gain experiences that develop their character. They undergo training under the guidance of our dedicated coaches and teachers. 

Sportsmanship and character building are the key focus of the Football Programme. Through the various activities and exposure, we hope to instill our schoolâ€™s core values of C4RE and develop the 21st CC skills in the players.
