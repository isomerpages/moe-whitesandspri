### **Tchoukball**
Tchoukball CCA in White Sands Primary School provides chances for our players to enjoy the game, experience camaraderie, boast their self-confidence and instill values like resilience and respect. Students will learn the basic Tchoukball skills like footwork, handling of balls and positional play in a game play.

At Primary 3 and 4, our players are in the development team and they learn the basic skills and rules of Tchoukball. They will be able to apply what they have learnt through simplified game play. Some Primary 4 players will be selected to train with the upper primary school team players to prepare them for the SPH Foundation National Primary Schools Tchoukball Championship (Junior).

At Primary 5 and 6, our players who are in the development team will further enhance their knowledge and application of Tchoukball rules and skills through game play. As for players in the school teams, they will train intensively to prepare them for the SPH Foundation National Primary Schools Tchoukball Championships which are held yearly.
