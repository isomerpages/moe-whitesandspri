### **In-Link Bulletin**
Dear parents/guardians,  

We hope that 2022 has been an exciting and fulfilling one for your children as more learning opportunities are made available both in school and beyond.  As the term is coming to an end, we would like to express our appreciation to all parents/guardians for your support and partnership in your child’s learning.

As we move into the last few weeks of the school term, we would like to keep you informed of some important events. To prepare your child for school re-opening in 2023, we will also be sending out the last ILB in Week 10 of the School Term.

#### **1. Safety matters – road diversion of traffic along Pasir Ris Drive 11 w.e.f 30 Oct 2022**
With reference to the Parent Gateway (PG) notification on CR107 - Road Closure circular sent on 20 Oct 2022, please remind your children of the traffic diversion when they return to school on Monday, 31 Oct 2022.

Those pupils who are taking the public transport of nine affected buses (21, 39, 53, 81, 109, 12, 12e, 17 and 518) are to note the new bus stops (bus stops no. 78191 & 78199) to alight. Please refer to the map in the PG attachment for the location of the bus stops. In view of the higher traffic volume, please also remind your child to set aside more time for travelling.

A gentle reminder for parents who are driving into the school, please have your child/children prepared for the drop-off. Do refrain from getting off the car to help them with their bags as it will delay the traffic flow. We seek your support in this matter.

#### **2. Deepavali Celebration**
The school will be celebrating Deepavali on Wednesday, 9 Nov 2022 with an assembly programme and an array of activities planned for the pupils. Through the Deepavali celebration, the school aims to provide authentic opportunities for pupils to experience the rich Indian tradition and culture and to celebrate the diversity of Singapore’s multicultural society.

#### **3. Primary 6 Hiking Program at MacRitchie Reservoir Park**
As part of the Primary 6 post-PSLE Programme, the PE department has organized a day hike for the pupils at the MacRitchie Reservoir Park.  The hike through nature trails will provide the pupils with opportunities to explore the distinct flora and fauna available in Singapore’s Central Catchment Area. Through the interaction with nature, we hope to instill a love for the outdoors in our pupils while laying a foundation for an active and healthy lifestyle.

Two to three classes will be scheduled to go each day on 8, 10 and 11 Nov 2022. More details will be communicated to you via PG.

#### **4. Results Processing Day 2022**
Please be reminded that Monday, 14 Nov 2022 will be results processing day. There will be no school for all pupils. The school’s Student Care Centre will remain open.

#### **5. Prize Giving Day 2022 and the last day of School for 2022**
We will be having our Annual Prize Giving Ceremony on Friday, 18 Nov 2022. The theme for this year’s Prize Giving Ceremony is “Celebration of Excellence”. It signifies us celebrating our pupils’ efforts and successes.

Invitations will be sent out to parents/guardians of award recipients via PG. This year, with the ease of SMM, we will be resuming our on-site Prize Giving Ceremony in school. Only award recipients will need to report to school that day. The last day of reporting for all other pupils will be on Thursday, 17 Nov 2022. The school will also be issuing the Holistic Report Book on 17 Nov 2022. Pupils are to bring back the Report Book when they report back to school next year on Wednesday, 4 Jan 2023.

We would like to extend our heartiest congratulations to all pupils in achieving their best this year. We also wish to recognise parents, teachers and all staff for their dedication and commitment in supporting our pupils’ holistic development.

#### **6. Donation of School Uniform and PE attire (Primary 6)**
We would like to appeal to the parents of our Primary 6 pupils to donate your child’s school uniform or the PE attire to the school if they are still in good condition. The donated uniform/PE attire will be used as spare sets for pupils who may require a change of attire during the school day. You may leave the neatly folded uniform/PE attire with the General Office after the release of the PSLE results. Do remember to remove the name tag from the uniform / PE attire.

#### **7. Coping with Anxiety**
Our partner, MWS Family Support Programme, has created a tip sheet on the topic of Coping with Anxiety. We hope you will find useful tips in Annex 1.

#### **8. Growth Mindset Nuggets #10: Building Positive Relationships**
In October’s issue, we invited parents to share their success stories on how you foster gratitude in your child at home. We thank all parents for your contributions.

| These days, instilling the value of gratitude seems more challenging than before. Children tend to take people and things for granted when everything is practically done for them. Thus, at home we have started with routines for our children to be responsible for household chores like washing the dishes they used for their own meals, vacuuming the floor, doing their own laundry including folding their own clothes and changing their own bedsheets. For us, it is a place to begin with that can at least make them realize that it takes time and effort to maintain and keep the household running and start appreciating the things we do for them. |

Positive relationships need to be built. Take time to listen when your children share, get to know their interests and dreams, affirm their positive qualities and encourage them to grow despite their limitations. Participate in activities and events with them. It is also important to choose activities that build on their interests and connect them with the community. For example, volunteering or participating in community-orientated activities enhances a parent-child relationship and increases their circle of empathy.

Here are some ways to build a strong relationship with your child:
*   Develop parent-child relationships that are loving, warm and responsive.
*   Encourage your child to share ideas based on his/her interests.
*   Allow and encourage your child to lead when playing together.
*   Build your child’s self-esteem and confidence by recognising his/her efforts and not just his/her successes.

When we have something exciting to share, we look forward to telling our loved ones. Close relationships are our social support in both good times and bad. Click the link to join Bobby in this short animation video as he enhances his relationships with the people around him.
