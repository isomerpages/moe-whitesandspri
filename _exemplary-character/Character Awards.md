### **Character Awards**
#### **Objective:**
The White Sands Primary School Character Awards seeks to affirm positive behaviors displayed by students.

#### **Key Programmes:**
The yearly awards are given based on the Values & Character Assessment where every student is graded based on personal qualities as well as the demonstration of school values.

*   **Model Pupil Award**<br>The Model Pupil Award is part of the school’s effort to nurture our pupils in character development. Students will be observed throughout the year and selected for the award if they exemplify the school’s values, show positive character traits as well as serve as role models to their peers. Selection of nominees is based on the school’s Values and Character Assessment.


*   **Award for Character Excellence(ACE) Award**<br>Students who have achieved up to Level 3 of the Model Pupil Award will be eligible for the ACE Award which recognizes their exemplary conduct. Deserving students will be receiving the award during our annual Prize Giving Day each year.

*   **MOE Edusave Character Award (ECHA)**<br>MOE has introduced a new Edusave Character Award (ECHA) to enable schools to recognise students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and actions.
