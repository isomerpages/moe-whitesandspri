### **C4RE Teacher Guidance Period/Assembly**
#### **Objective:**
The C4RE Teacher Guidance period (CTGP) is conducted once a week within the school’s curriculum time for all classes by all C4RE teachers. It supports the purposeful teacher-student interactions and the explicit teaching of social and emotional competencies. It is also a platform for teachers and students to establish good teacher-student relationships and to allow teachers to identify the needs of students so as to provide them with better support.

#### **Key Programmes:**
During CTGP, the following takes place:<br>
\-    Explicit teaching of social and emotional competencies <br>
\-    Interactive Activities to enhance TSR (Teacher-Student Relationship) and SSR ( Student-Student Relationship)<br>
\-    Heart to Heart (H2H) sessions to foster better TSR through one-to-one interaction.<br>
