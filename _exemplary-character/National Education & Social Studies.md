b. Participating daily routines such as Flag-Raising Ceremony, singing of the National Anthem and reciting the National Pledge to reinforce the values we stand for as a nation<br>
c. Discussing of NE-related topics not only in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), but also across multiple subject areas including Social Studies, Math, Science, Art and Music<br>
