#### **Character and Citizenship Education Lessons** 

These lessons which include CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP), CCE Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) and Programme for Active Learning (PAL) provide the time for teachers to engage and build relationships with their students through discussions and effective classroom strategies. 

Broadly, there are three ways CCE lesson time is used: <br>

(i) explicit teaching of values, and social and emotional skills addresses the holistic developmental needs of students, e.g. understanding emotions and how to regulate them, learning how to manage relationships, and developing skills for responsible decision-making and deepening moral values and one’s cultural identity in CCE (MTL). 

(ii) equip students with knowledge and skills to better understand and navigate the real-world, e.g. understand mental health issues, navigate cyberspace responsibly, make appropriate educational and career choices, appreciate family life, understand Singapore’s racial and religious diversity; and 

(iii) provide opportunities for contribution to family, school and community through VIA projects. Time will be given to identify the needs and establish the intent of project, planning the activities and reflecting on learning.
