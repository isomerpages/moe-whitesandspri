### **C4RE Teacher Guidance Period/Assembly**
#### **Objective:**
The C4RE Teacher Guidance period (CTGP) is conducted once or twice a week within the school’s curriculum time for all classes by all C4RE teachers. It supports the purposeful teacher-student interactions and the explicit teaching of values and social and emotional competencies through MOE’s CCE (Form Teacher Guidance Period) curriculum.<br>

It is also a platform for teachers and students to establish good teacher-student relationships and to allow teachers to identify the needs of students so as to provide them with better support.


#### **Key Programmes:**
During CTGP, the following takes place:<br>
\-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Explicit teaching of social and emotional competencies <br>
\-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Interactive Activities to enhance TSR (Teacher-Student Relationship) and SSR ( Student-Student Relationship)<br>
\-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Heart to Heart (H2H) sessions to foster better TSR through one-to-one interaction.<br>


### **Assembly**

Assembly periods serve as a key platform for mass gatherings, fostering a sense of school identity and community. They provide opportunities for the inculcation of values through talks by school leaders, student leaders, and programme owners. These engagements help reinforce school values, address important topics, and inspire students to display positive behaviors in their daily lives.
