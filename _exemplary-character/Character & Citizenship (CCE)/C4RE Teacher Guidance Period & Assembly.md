### **C4RE Teacher Guidance Period/Assembly**
#### **Objective:**
The C4RE Teacher Guidance period (CTGP) is conducted once a week within the school’s curriculum time for all classes by all C4RE teachers. It supports the purposeful teacher-student interactions and the explicit teaching of social and emotional competencies. It is also a platform for teachers and students to establish good teacher-student relationships and to allow teachers to identify the needs of students so as to provide them with better support.

#### **Key Programmes:**
During CTGP, the following takes place:<br>
\-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Explicit teaching of social and emotional competencies <br>
\-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Interactive Activities to enhance TSR (Teacher-Student Relationship) and SSR ( Student-Student Relationship)<br>
\-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Heart to Heart (H2H) sessions to foster better TSR through one-to-one interaction.<br>


### **CCE Lessons**

These lessons which include CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP), CCE Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) and Programme for Active Learning (PAL) provide the time for teachers to engage and build relationships with their students through discussions and effective classroom strategies. 

Broadly, there are three ways CCE lesson time is used: 

(i) explicit teaching of values, and social and emotional skills addresses the holistic developmental needs of students, e.g. understanding emotions and how to regulate them, learning how to manage relationships, and developing skills for responsible decision-making and deepening moral values and one’s cultural identity in CCE (MTL). 

(ii) equip students with knowledge and skills to better understand and navigate the real-world, e.g. understand mental health issues, navigate cyberspace responsibly, make appropriate educational and career choices, appreciate family life, understand Singapore’s racial and religious diversity; and 

(iii) provide opportunities for contribution to family, school and community through VIA projects. Time will be given to identify the needs and establish the intent of project, planning the activities and reflecting on learning.
