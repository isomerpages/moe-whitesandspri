### **Education and Career Guidance**
#### **Objective:**
The Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is a developmental programme which facilitates the acquisition of attitudes, skills and knowledge that will enable students to better understand themselves, explore viable education and career pathways and make informed decisions to develop plans to achieve their future aspirations. Through the programme, students build self-confidence as they are more aware of their own skills, values and strengths. They will seek to establish clear educational goals as they perceive relevance of schooling efforts.

#### **Key Programme:**
*   **MySkillsFuture Portal**<br>MySkillsFuture (Primary) Portal is a one-stop portal that helps students start on a journey of self-discovery and make informed education and career choices. Students can use information and tools to explore the education and career landscapes in Singapore.


*   **ECG Career Fair Talk (P6)**<br>The ECG Career Fair Talk is designed to broaden our students' horizons by exposing them to various professions and industries. The school will be inviting parents and guest speakers to share their career highlights for this talk. Through the speakersâ€™ valuable insights and experiences, students will be equipped with the knowledge and insights needed to make informed career choices.
