### **Student Leadership**
#### **Objective:**
It is our belief that every White Sands student is a leader. Anchoring on this, the school provides values-driven student leadership curriculum - Student Leadership Development (SLD) to develop our leaders to their full potential. Through the SLD, we envision that every student becomes an inspiring leader who leads with a heart and makes a positive difference to others.
