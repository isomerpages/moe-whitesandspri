### **Student Leadership**
#### **Objective:**
It is our belief that every White Sands student is a leader. Anchoring on this, the school provides values-driven student leadership curriculum - Student Leadership Development (SLD) to develop our leaders to their full potential. Through the SLD, we envision that every student becomes an inspiring leader who leads with a heart and makes a positive difference to others.

#### **Key Programmes:**
##### **Three Focus Areas of Leadership**
The three focus areas of leadership are: Self, Peer and Community.

1\.  **Self Leadership** for Primary 1 and 2 students:<br>
The focus is on growing the students’ capacity to achieve self-mastery and personal effectiveness. Through the leadership curriculum, students will grow in their desire, confidence and capacity to take ownership of one’s own growth and development.

2\.  **Peer Leadership** for Primary 3 and 4 students:<br>
The focus is on growing students’ capacity to lead others with care and competence. This will be achieved through developing their dispositions and capacity to lead others.

3\.  **Service Leadership** for Primary 5 and 6 students:<br>
The focus is on growing students’ capacity to put other people’s needs first before their own. This will be achieved through the discovery of meaningfulness to serve and lead others.

##### **School’s Prefectorial Board**
During the end of Term 3 every year, C4RE teachers will nominate deserving students to become Prefects. They will then go through group interviews to qualify for the next round of selection.
