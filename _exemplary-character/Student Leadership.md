#### **WSPS Student Leadership Framework**


![](/images/Leadership.jpg)

<br>It is our belief that every White Sands student is a leader. Anchoring on this, the school provides values-driven student leadership curriculum - Student Leadership Development (SLD) to develop our leaders to their full potential. Through the SLD, we envision that every student becomes an inspiring leader who leads with a heart and makes a positive difference to others.

##### **Objectives**<br>
1.	Equip all students (Student Leaders, Class Leaders and CCA leaders ) with leadership knowledge, attributes and skills to take on opportunities and challenges.  

2.	Empower all students with opportunities to carry out their roles and responsibilities in internal and external events or activities.

#### **Student Leadership Structure**

In WSPS, all our students have opportunities to develop their leadership capacity through a four-tier approach.  



##### **Prefectorial Board**
Our Prefectorial Board is made up of Primary 3 to Primary 6 Prefects. After a series of selection processes, the Prefects are sworn in during the annual Student Leadersâ€™ Investiture.

Besides attending trainings, workshops and learning journeys, our Prefects were also given opportunities to initiate programmes and/or projects to improve the well-being of their peers and/or community.
