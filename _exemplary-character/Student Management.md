<h3><strong>Vision</strong>:</h3>
<p>Every White Sandian to discern right from wrong</p>
<h3><strong>Mission</strong>:</h3>
<p>To nurture students’ core values and social emotional competencies through
guidance in making good choices in decision-making.</p>
<h4><strong>Key programmes</strong>:</h4>
<h4><strong>Catch You Doing Good</strong></h4>
<p>In WSPS, “Catch You Doing Good” hopes to inspire students to do good,
showcase the positive achievements and in turn inspire others to make a
positive impact.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to be vigilant observers of the positive actions
of their peers. Whether it is a small act of kindness, a community service
project, or a selfless gesture, students are on the lookout for those who
exemplify the school values.</p>
<p>Students are equipped with "Catch You Doing Good” cards. The cards are
simple tokens of appreciation that they can hand out to their peers caught
in the act of doing good. They also serve as tangible reminders that their
positive actions are noticed, appreciated and celebrated.</p>
<p>What makes this programme truly special is its emphasis on creating a
ripple effect of positivity. Recipients of the cards are encouraged to
pay it forward by catching others doing good. This creates a chain reaction,
fostering a culture of kindness and reinforcing the idea that every positive
action, no matter how small, contributes to a collective force for good.</p>
<p>"Catch You Doing Good” is more than just a programme; it is a movement
that fosters a culture of kindness and gratitude. As students catch one
another doing good, they also develop a heightened awareness of the positive
potential within themselves and their peers. It is a reminder that even
in the busiest of days, a moment of goodness can make a lasting impact.</p>
