##### **Rationale:**

*  Student well-being program is anchored in our Student-Well-being Framework that seeks to develop every White Sandian to achieve their personal best and strive  for  success. <br>
* The framework is anchored in our belief that it takes a village to raise a child and that every White Sandian has the potential to succeed if there is a collective and systematic effort and a positive school culture. We hope to develop a growth mindset in our students that enables them to be confident when approaching tasks and to turn challenges into opportunities.  Over time, a growth mindset will ensure that students are adaptable and flexible to change and growth.<br>
* The school motto of  ‘Learn  Grow  Excel  Together’  represents  how  students,  staff  and  stakeholders  can  rally together  to  bring  out  the  best  in  our  students’  potential  through  a  well-rounded  and  holistic  education  amidst  a caring and inclusive environment in pursuit of excellence.

#### **Peer Support and Relationships**

**Communicate, Coordinate, Collaborate!**

For students to flourish (feel good and do good), respectful relationships and a learning community that is positive, inclusive and resilient are essential.  Through consistent communication among all students, parents and teachers, coordinated school initiatives and collaboration within and outside of school, we aim to engage the hearts and minds of our students and promote and protect their holistic health.
