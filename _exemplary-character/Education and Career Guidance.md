### **Education and Career Guidance**
#### **Objective:**
The Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is a developmental programme which facilitates the acquisition of attitudes, skills and knowledge that will enable students to better understand themselves, explore viable education and career pathways and make informed decisions to develop plans to achieve their future aspirations. Through the programme, students build self-confidence as they are more aware of their own skills, values and strengths. They will seek to establish clear educational goals as they perceive relevance of schooling efforts.

#### **Key Programme:**
*   **MySkillsFuture Portal**<br>Every student from P5 & P6 will be briefed on the online platform MySkillsFuture Portal at the beginning of the year. It is a one-stop portal that helps students start on a journey of self-discovery and make informed education and career choices. Students can use information and tools to explore the education and career landscapes in Singapore.
