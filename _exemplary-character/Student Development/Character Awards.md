### **Character Awards**
#### **Objective:**
The White Sands Primary School Character Awards seeks to affirm positive behaviors displayed by students.

Students will be observed throughout the year and selected for the award if they exemplify the school’s values, show positive character traits as well as serve as role models to their peers. Selection of nominees is based on the school’s Values and Character Assessment.
